# Tip Calculator

## Overview

Welcome to the Tip Calculator repository! This project was born out of a personal experience during my trip to the USA. Coming from a Latino background where tips and taxes are usually included in the bills, I found it a bit different in the US, where they are separate. This led to the creation of the Tip Calculator – a feature-rich and user-friendly web application designed to simplify tip calculations. Whether you are a restaurant-goer, coffee enthusiast, or just someone navigating the nuances of separate tips and taxes, this Tip Calculator has you covered.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface:** The intuitive design ensures a seamless user experience, making it easy for anyone to calculate tips quickly.
- **Customizable Settings:** Personalize your tip calculation by adjusting settings such as tip percentage and the number of people sharing the bill.
- **Real-time Updates:** Watch as the app dynamically updates the total amount, tip amount, and per-person share as you make changes.
- **Responsive Design:** Access the Tip Calculator from any device – desktop, tablet, or mobile – and enjoy a consistent and responsive layout.
